## Background

LODopt is a statistical method to estimate changes in the absolute cell
composition of different cell-types in a tissue using single cell
assay-based counts of cells assigned to a given clusters/cell types per
biological unit/sample. It is based on the optimal identification of
sample-specific normalization factors to account for input tissue size
differences followed by fitting a Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model
(GLMM) using the observed counts per sample per cluster. The range of
scenarios over which the inferences derived from LODopt represent
changes in (unobserved) absolute counts of different cell-types is much
broader than those for other available approaches. Based on tests using
simulated data, in comparison to exisiting approaches, LODOpt maintains
the correct Type I error, has minimal bias in the estimated parameters
of interest and comparable statistical power.

## Installation

Currently the only way to install is by using the package`devtools`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("gladstone-institutes/LODopt")
```

If you get an error message and everything is spelled correctly, follow
these steps before trying again:

``` r
#set config
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "YourName", user.email = "your@mail.com")

#Go to github page to generate token
usethis::create_github_token() 

#paste your PAT into pop-up that follows...
credentials::set_github_pat()
```
